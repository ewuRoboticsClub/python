### 7.1.1. Print Factors of a Number



**Solution: 1**

--------------------


```python
def isPrime(x):             # checks a number whether its prime or not
    i = 2
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
        i+=1
    return True


# main program starts from here

n = int(input("Take an Input: "))  # input() function takes input as string.
                                       # int() converts this string to integer type
factor = []                           # Empty list declaration
tmp = n

for i in range(2,n):                # looping from 2 to n
    if isPrime(i) and n%i == 0:   # if i is prime and n is divisible by i
        while n%i == 0:           # loop runs until n is divisible by i
            n/=i;                   # dividing n by i
            factor.append(i)      # inserting current prime factor in list

if n>1:
    factor.append(n)

print("Prime factors of %d: "%tmp,end='')
print(factor)




```

    Take an Input: 180
    Prime factors of 180: [2, 2, 3, 3, 5]
    

***In function print("Prime factors of %d: "%tmp,end=''),  '%tmp' tends to put the value in 'tmp' in replace of '%d' portion of that function. end ='' is used to avoid any by default printing of newline from printf function***
