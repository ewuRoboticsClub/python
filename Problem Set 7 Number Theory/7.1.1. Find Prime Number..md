# 7.1.1. Find Prime Number
-------------------------------

### Hints: A prime number is that which can only be divisible by 1 and that number itself. If a number N is not a prime then it must have a divisor between 1 and N. The program will identify a prime number by iterating from 2 to N-1 and check whether it is divisible by any of those or not. If divisible then it is not prime, otherwise prime.  

-------------------

Solution: 1 
--------


```python
# checks If a given number N is prime of Not 

N = int(input("Take an input: "))
flag = True

for i in range(2,N):
    if N%i == 0:
        flag = False
        break

if flag == True:
    print("{0} is a prime".format(N))
else:
    print("{0} is not a prime".format(N))
```

    Take an input: 19
    19 is a prime
    

### Comment
--------------------

***This program only checks whether a given input is prime or not. The Line-***

```print("{0} is a prime".format(N))```

***refers to formating the output. For a single variable {0}, for two varibles {0},{1} and for N variable {0},{1},{2}......{N-1} are given inside double quotation.format() is a built-in function of string data type. For example, in the code "{0} is not a prime" is a string. A dot after this string refers to suggest all built-in functions of this string. format() function can take N variables as argument as like string.format(v0,v1,v2....vN-1). For example,*** 

```print("{0} is less than {1}".format(2,5))```

***which shows formating of two variables.***

Solution: 2 
--------


```python
# it will print all prime number less then n

def isPrime(x):                    # checks a number whether its prime or not
    i = 2
    while i < x:
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
        i+=1
    return True

# main program starts from here

n = int(input("Take an Input: "))  # input() function takes input as string.
                                       # int() converts this string to integer type

prime = []

for i in range(2,n):
    if isPrime(i):
        prime.append(i)

print("Prime number till {0}: ".format(n),end='')
print(prime)


```

    Take an Input: 19
    Prime number till 19: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
    

Solution: 3
------


```python
def isPrime(x):                    # checks a number whether its prime or not
    i = 2
    while i*i <= x:
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
        i+=1
    return True

# main program starts from here

n = int(input("Take an Input: "))  # input() function takes input as string.
                                   # int() converts this string to integer type

prime = [i for i in range(2,n) if isPrime(i)==True]   # comprehension method. Discussed detailed in comment section

print("Prime number till {0}: ".format(n),end='')
print(prime)
```

    Take an Input: 10
    Prime number till 10: [2, 3, 5, 7]
    

### Comment
---------------
```prime = [i for i in range(2,n) if isPrime(i)==True]```

***this is called comprihension method. In this method the first 'i' is used as a variable which value is to be inserted, the second 'i' is for iteration of loop from 2 to n. The code portion inside [] returns a list of the numbers for which the function isPrime(i) returns True. such as 2,3,5... etc***
